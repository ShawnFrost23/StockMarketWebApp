Week 1 

Formed a group of 5. Picked the portfolio management project. Agreed everyone would
read project proposal guidelines and marking criteria to kick off discussion next Monday
night. Group decided to meet 3x a week on Monday, Wednesday and Friday at 7pm. 
I created a What's App group to facilitate all group communications outside of UNSW, 
Github and Jira. I also created a Google Drive folder to house documentation. Prep for next 
week included mapping background, user stories, sprints and architecture diagrams. 

Week 2

Met Monday night to discuss epic and user stories. Met again on Wednesday afternoon to 
divide proposal work up and settle on requirements. This week i wrote the background
section for the proposal and helped consolidate user stories and sprints in preparation
for proposal submission. 

Week 3

Met Monday night to run through progress. Sent Rachid a copy of proposal 
to give feedback for weekly meeting on Wednesday. Following feedback from Rachid helped
clarify and edit proposal in preparation for submission. Just waiting on submission to 
begin setting up environment for development and sprint 1.
