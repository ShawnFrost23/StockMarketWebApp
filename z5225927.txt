# Week 1 - Creation of the team during the Lab. We discussed all the projects and decided to pick up the stock portfolio project based on everyone's proposition. 
  We began to brain storm main ideas regarding the website, Various APIs and new features which can make the paltform stand out of already existing products.

# Week 2 - First meeting during which we discussed main features required to achieve a functioning website. We went through the main features needed for the website
  in order to enchange the user's experience. Main topics were related to User's Interface and financial tools which are not present on concurent platforms.

           Second meeting focussed on laying down the plan for the project proposal and a break down of tasks for each group member. I was assigned to work on the 
   website's user interface for the proposal with Arth, and the website's flow diagram.
   
# Week 3 - The first meeting focussed to catch up with everyone's work and progress on the main google file.
