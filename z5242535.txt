## Week 1

I have a great feeling for my group, so glad to be working with fantastic developers. All 5 of us happen to have a strong interest in Finance so we quickly decided on the stock management project.

My team makes decisions with consultation, and we're also fast to come to an consensus which is great. During the first tutorial, we discussed mark expectations, availability, set work expectations, and had enough time to introduce ourselves. Looking forward to a great term!

## Week 2

Made good progress with planning the project.

Had a good meeting on Wednesday, planned to write up report for sync on Monday evening.

Spent the Week 2 weekend helping to write the user stories section of our proposal.

## Week 3

Team met up at 7pm on Monday night to discuss progress and any blockers. We're on track to show Rachid a draft on Wednesday. Next meeting will be immediately after our tutorial time with Rachid.

Finished our project proposal ahead of time.

## Week 4

Sprint begins! Initially focused on setting up the backend (Python) infrastructure.

## Week 5

Made good progress and finished well before the deadline. All sprint tickets were completed.

I took on more frontend tickets and was glad I still remembered my COMP6080 React skills!

I was very happy with the demo, which was led by Matt.

The team met up on Monday, twice on Tuesday, and completed Retro A on Wednesday.

The team met up on Thursday to kick off the new sprint and assign tickets. Spoke at length about core technical decisions to make.

## Week 6

Started the week with researching our approach to using APIs. The key challenge is finding a free API that suits our application.

Team meeting 7pm Monday 22 March.

## Week 7
Wrote my feature, making use of the Yahoo Finance API. It was unfortunately slow but the API was the best we could find for free.
Helped out the team with pair programming sessions as well.

## Week 8
Dan presented the demo and did a great job. I'm happy with how we finished all the tickets, and how we finished well ahead of the deadline.
I'm also happy that during the sprint we had the discipline to stick to our original plan, and did not increase the scope of the sprint.

## Week 9
A more relaxed week. Things are getting busy at work, so I had to spend more time on work during the week.
Back on 3900 for the weekend, writing my section of the report, writing my feature (advanced financial metrics), and reviewing code quality of the app.

## Week 10
