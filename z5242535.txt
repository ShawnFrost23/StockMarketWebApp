## Week 1

I have a great feeling for my group, so glad to be working with fantastic developers. All 5 of us happen to have a strong interest in Finance so we quickly decided on the stock management project.

My team makes decisions with consultation, and we're also fast to come to an consensus which is great. During the first tutorial, we discussed mark expectations, availability, set work expectations, and had enough time to introduce ourselves. Looking forward to a great term!

## Week 2

Made good progress with planning the project.

Had a good meeting on Wednesday, planned to write up report for sync on Monday evening.

Spent the Week 2 weekend helping to write the user stories section of our proposal.

## Week 3

Team met up at 7pm on Monday night to discuss progress and any blockers. We're on track to show Rachid a draft on Wednesday. Next meeting will be immediately after our tutorial time with Rachid.

Finished our project proposal ahead of time.

## Week 4

Sprint begins!
