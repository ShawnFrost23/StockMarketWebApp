Week 1

This week I formed a group of 5 with my classmates. We decide to proceed with the portfolio management tool after considering other available options. During the session, we introduce ourselves to each other
and started to brainstorm our approach to build this product.

Week 2

In our team meeting, we discussed the main functionalities of the product and the technology we plan to use.
We split up the work to write our user stories on Jira. I was assigned to write the user stories of optimizing the user's portfolio. We also split the user stories into different sprints. This is a very important preparation 
for our project proposal which is due next week. 

Week 3

I helped to create and edit the user stories in the proposal. I also created the software architecture diagram in the proposal. After I reached out to our tutor Rachid, I added a description of software architecture based on his feedback. I started to research on what is the best cloud infrastructure for us to build our web app on 
and I plan to deploy our web app and build our CI/CD pipeline on AWS next week.
